# Core Python packages (most are in standard library)
# This tool primarily uses Python standard library modules:
# - subprocess: For executing system commands
# - json: For JSON report generation  
# - csv: For parsing airodump-ng CSV output
# - argparse: For command-line argument parsing
# - datetime: For timestamps and time tracking
# - collections: For data structures (defaultdict)
# - tempfile: For temporary file management
# - hashlib: For hashing operations
# - signal: For signal handling (Ctrl+C)
# - sys, os: For system operations
# - time: For timing and delays
# - re: For regular expressions

# No additional Python packages required!
# This tool is designed to work with Python 3.7+ standard library only.

# However, if you want to extend the tool with additional features,
# you might consider these optional packages:

# Optional: For enhanced reporting and visualization
# matplotlib>=3.5.0
# pandas>=1.3.0
# plotly>=5.0.0

# Optional: For advanced networking features  
# scapy>=2.4.5
# netaddr>=0.8.0

# Optional: For database integration
# sqlite3 (included in Python standard library)

# Note: The main dependencies are SYSTEM PACKAGES, not Python packages:
# - aircrack-ng suite (airmon-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, aircrack-ng)
# - reaver (for WPS attacks)
# - wash (WPS scanner, part of reaver)
# - hostapd (for AP functionality)
# - dnsmasq (for DHCP functionality)
# - bluetooth tools (bluetoothctl, hcitool)
# - hcxtools (optional, for advanced handshake handling)

# Install system dependencies with:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng reaver hostapd dnsmasq bluetooth bluez-utils hcxtools
# Fedora/RHEL:   sudo dnf install aircrack-ng reaver hostapd dnsmasq bluez-tools hcxtools  
# Arch Linux:    sudo pacman -S aircrack-ng reaver hostapd dnsmasq bluez-utils hcxtools

# Python version requirement
# python>=3.7
